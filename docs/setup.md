# Setup and local development

Operational detail moved out of the rule docs. `api.md`, `agent.md` and
`environment.md` are what agents read before changing code; this is what a person
reads once.

## First run

```sh
cp .env.example .env        # fill DATABASE_URL, BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, ALLOWED_SIGN_IN
docker compose up -d        # Postgres, matching .env.example
bun run db:migrate && bun run db:seed
bun run dev                 # app :3000, api :3001, agent :2000
```

Prisma from the repo root: `db:generate`, `db:migrate`, `db:push`, `db:reset`,
`db:seed`, `db:studio`, `db:deploy`.

`dev` depends on `^dev:prepare`, so every start applies pending migrations and
regenerates the Prisma client before a single server boots. That is why the first
run needs `db:migrate` only for the seed that follows it. When the database and
`schema.prisma` have diverged past what `migrate deploy` can reconcile,
`dev:prepare` stops the whole run rather than starting servers against a schema
they do not match — reconcile with `db:migrate`, or `db:reset` when the divergence
is an edited migration that has already been applied.

## Google Cloud

- **Enable the Gmail API and the Google Calendar API** on the project.
- **Set the consent screen to User type: Internal** if you are on Workspace.
  `gmail.readonly` is a *restricted* scope, so an External app needs OAuth
  verification plus an annual CASA assessment. Going External later means the full
  review — a decision, not a checkbox.

## The agent bridge

```sh
AGENT_URL="http://127.0.0.1:2000"   # 127.0.0.1, not localhost: eve dev is IPv4-only
AGENT_BRIDGE_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

| Agent tab error | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `503` | `AGENT_BRIDGE_SECRET` unset in the app's process |
| `401` | The two processes hold different secrets, **or** `passThroughEnv` in `apps/app/turbo.json` / `apps/agent/turbo.json` is missing the pair (Turbo is strict-env) |
| `502` | Agent not running, or `AGENT_URL` wrong |

`localDev()` accepts any loopback request, so `curl 127.0.0.1` proves nothing about
the bridge — send `-H 'Host: agent.example.com'`. `GET /eve/v1/info` is the whole
inventory, including a `diagnostics` count that finds files eve silently ignored.

## Inbound Slack needs one hostname, forever

Slack posts events to a request URL it stores once. `cloudflared tunnel --url`
invents a new hostname on every restart, so the stored URL goes stale and Slack
stops delivering **without an error anywhere** — the endpoint is simply never
called. A named tunnel keeps the hostname across restarts.

```sh
brew install cloudflared
cloudflared tunnel login            # opens a browser, once
SLACK_TUNNEL_HOSTNAME="crm-dev.example.com" bun run tunnel:slack
```

The hostname must be on a domain in your own Cloudflare account. `tunnel:slack`
creates the tunnel if it is missing, points the DNS record at it, prints the
request URL and then runs it. Re-running is safe. Put the hostname in `.env` and
the variable can be dropped from the command.

Paste the printed URL into the Slack app's Event Subscriptions page and
subscribe to `message.channels`, `app_mention` and `member_joined_channel`.

**Set `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` before you paste the URL.** It is the Signing Secret
on the Slack app's Basic Information page. The API refuses every unsigned request,
including Slack's first URL verification, so without it the page never verifies
and delivery never starts.

**Socket Mode swallows events.** With Socket Mode on, the Request URL still shows
"Verified" and no HTTP delivery ever happens. Turn it off.

## Running the agent

The agent package's default `dev` command is interactive `eve dev`. The root
Turbo task marks it interactive, so select the agent pane and press Enter before
using the eve TUI. Run `turbo run dev:headless --filter=agent` when a terminal
cannot render the TUI; that uses `eve dev --no-ui`, and the Turbo pane is the
record because only interactive development writes `.eve/logs/` for `eve logs`.
Reach for the Turbo task rather than `bun run --filter=agent dev:headless`: the
package script alone skips `dev:prepare`, so the agent would start against
unmigrated tables.

`hooks/activity.ts` is the replacement narration, **to stderr** (the TUI hides
stdout), printing shape everywhere and argument contents outside production only. It
is **not the audit trail** — `hooks/audit.ts` writes `AgentEvent` regardless.

- A second `bun run dev` fails the whole turbo run.
- An orphaned agent holds the port: `lsof -nP -iTCP:2000 -sTCP:LISTEN`.

### Nothing is researching, and the queue only grows

**`eve dev` never fires schedules on their cron cadence**, and everything visible
still works — the row is written, the sheet says *Queued*, and `dispatch.ts` is never
called. The poke covers this **only when `AGENT_BRIDGE_SECRET` is set**; unset,
`poke()` returns silently and the queue looks exactly like a slow agent.

Tasks the API did not write (`schedule_recheck`) and anything queued while the agent
was down still need a manual run:

```sh
bun run --filter=agent dispatch    # exact production path, both lanes, real credits
```

Its printed `sessionIds` are research rows only, so a run that resolved forty logos
prints an empty list and was not idle. `eve start` and Vercel do run the schedule.

## `vercel env pull` writes `.env.local`, which wins

`.env.local` is the override the loader reads *last*, and `vercel env pull` writes
**production** credentials there by default. Pull once and every process silently
points at production — not as an error, but as `bun run dev` working perfectly against
the live database. On 2026-08-01 eleven migrations landed on Neon from a laptop.

1. **Pull somewhere inert**: `vercel env pull .env.vercel`.
2. **`packages/db/scripts/require-local-db.ts` guards `db:migrate`, `db:push`,
   `db:reset`, `db:seed`** and takes `ALLOW_REMOTE_DB=1`. `db:deploy` is unguarded on
   purpose. It reads the root files directly rather than `process.env`, because Bun
   auto-loads the working directory's `.env` while Prisma's CLI only sees
   `@crm/env/load`.

## Migrations run on the production deploy, and nowhere else

`apps/api/scripts/build-func.mjs` runs `prisma migrate deploy` during the crm-api
build, gated on `VERCEL_ENV === "production"`. The schema therefore moves when the
release pull request merges and `release` deploys — with the code that needs it,
and once rather than once per branch.

Preview deploys share the production database: `DATABASE_URL` is a single value
across production, preview and development. Until that changes, **a preview of a
branch that adds a migration runs against a database without those tables** — it
builds, and the pages that touch them fail. Test schema changes locally, where
`bun run dev` migrates for you. Before the gate existed the reverse was true and
worse: every preview applied its own migrations to the production database, so on
2026-08-07 the live schema ran six migrations ahead of the live code all day.

### `migrate deploy` is not proof the schema is right

The build follows the deploy with `prisma migrate diff --exit-code` against
`schema.prisma` and shouts in the build log when they disagree. **`No pending
migrations to apply` only means `_prisma_migrations` has a row for every file** —
it says nothing about what the tables actually look like.

They came apart once. A `prisma db push` shaped production from a laptop, the
migration rows were recorded as applied without their SQL ever running, and
`agentConversationAttachment` went live without its `position` column. Every deploy
reported nothing pending, for days, while `conversations.builderById` returned 500.
The tell is an object in the database that no migration defines — there was an
`agentConversationAttachment_submissionId_createdAt_idx` that appears in no
migration file, only in a `db push` of an older schema.

Reconciling is one command, and it is worth reading before running:

```sh
DATABASE_URL="…" bunx prisma migrate diff \
  --from-config-datasource --to-schema prisma/schema.prisma --script
```

## Secrets hygiene

`.gitignore` ignores `.env` and `.env.*` with one negation for `.env.example`, so
`.env.bak` is ignored too. `.env.example` ships no secret — placeholders are empty
strings, asserted by `packages/env/test/root.spec.ts`. **Generate your own secret**;
never reuse one from an example, a tutorial, or another environment.

## Tests

```sh
bun run --filter=api test
bun run --filter=agent test    # integration specs need DATABASE_URL + real Postgres
```

### The test database rebuilds itself when it drifts

`bun run db:test` creates `crm_test` and runs `migrate deploy` on it. The database
name must end in `_test`; the suite deletes rows it expects to put back, so it
refuses anything else.

**`migrate deploy` only applies migrations that are missing. It never removes a
table, a column or a constraint the database has and the schema does not.** A
`crm_test` built on a branch that was later abandoned therefore keeps that branch's
objects forever, and `db:test` used to report `already exists` and move on. The
extra objects are invisible until one of them rejects a write, and then the failure
names a constraint that appears in no migration and in no schema — a stray
`trackedEvent_visitorId_fkey` once failed seven tracking specs this way, on every
branch, for as long as the database survived.

So `db:test` now checks the database it found and rebuilds it when either is true:

- **It holds a migration this branch does not have.** The database came from
  another branch. The name of the first one is printed.
- **It no longer matches `schema.prisma`**, by `prisma migrate diff`. Something
  was pushed or altered by hand.

A rebuild drops the database and re-runs every migration, and it says which of the
two reasons fired. Force one with `bun run db:test --reset`. Nothing else in the
repo may drop a database, and this may only because the `_test` suffix is checked
first.
