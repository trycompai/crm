# API Rules

## Logging

`apps/api/src/logging`. `new Logger(Thing.name)` picks up `ContextLogger`. **Never
`console.log`.** Format follows `NODE_ENV` and is not configurable.

- **One object, not extra arguments** — `logger.log({ message: "Saved", userId })`;
  Nest prints a line per argument.
- **Errors pass the stack second** — `logger.error({ message }, err.stack)`. Passing
  the error object drops the trace.
- **Never log headers, query strings, or bodies** — cookies and personal data.
- **`LoggingModule` stays first in `AppModule`'s imports**, and Better Auth routes log
  via its own `middleware` option — it mounts before `MiddlewareConsumer`, so
  `/api/auth/*` never reaches ours.
- `requestId` from `RequestLoggerMiddleware` via `AsyncLocalStorage`;
  `UserContextInterceptor` adds `userId`. Prisma statements are opt-in
  (`PRISMA_LOG_QUERIES`).

## Intelligence never lives in the API

The API serves HTTP, auth, tRPC and the mailbox sync. It does **not** research, enrich,
score, summarise, match identities or decide anything about a person or company — not
as a fallback, not behind a flag. That is the eve agent in `apps/agent`, which owns
the vendor clients, the confidence model and the writes.

Nest's half is to report *that something happened*: `AgentTriggerService` writes an
`AgentTask` row. A row, not an HTTP call — the agent already leases from that table,
so the row survives the agent being down.

About to add a vendor client to `apps/api`? You want `apps/agent/agent/lib`. Two
documented exceptions, and neither decides anything about a person: the
exchange-rate fetcher, below, and **the mail the API sends and receives** —
`MailboxApiClient` for Gmail and Graph, and `ResendService` for marketing. A
mail provider carries a message somebody already wrote; a data vendor forms an
opinion about somebody. The rule is about the second.

## One organization, and it is not a tenancy boundary

Single tenant. No org header, no org interceptor, no org-scoped cache keys, **no
`organizationId` on any CRM record.**

A **singleton workspace** exists — Better Auth's `organization` plugin, one row with
id `WORKSPACE_ID` (the literal `workspace`, in `@crm/db`, re-exported by `@crm/auth`
so the agent needn't depend on it). It answers only: what are we called, who works
here, what do we sell.

- **The id is a constant, never a parameter.** A function taking an `organizationId`
  has turned the plugin into tenancy plumbing.
- **Signing in is the join; no invite flow.** `ensureWorkspaceMembership` runs in
  `databaseHooks.session.create.before` and **degrades, never throws** — a throw fails
  the session create and locks everyone out. The plugin's `invitation` table is unused.
- **First account is owner**, and the hook enrols pre-existing users, oldest first.
- **Permissions come from `@crm/auth`** — `canRenameWorkspace`, `canChangeRole`,
  `canConfigureSso`, `canManageCurrency` — enforced by the service *and* used to
  disable the UI control, so the button and the 403 cannot disagree.
  `WorkspaceService` adds one invariant: **the last owner cannot be demoted**, with
  `FOR UPDATE` on the owner rows before counting.
- **Reads and writes go through tRPC**, not `authClient.organization.*`.
- **Name and website are required at onboarding and cannot be skipped**, in the form
  *and* in `updateWorkspaceInput`, posting the same `workspace.update` as settings.
- **Onboarded state is `onboardedAt` inside the plugin's `metadata` blob**, not a
  column; `isOnboarded`/`markOnboarded` (`@crm/db/workspace`) are the only accessors,
  and `markOnboarded` preserves every other key.
- **The name starts as `DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_NAME` (`CRM`), a placeholder not an
  answer.** The header renders `<name> CRM`, so `workspaceLabel` tests the name rather
  than comparing to the default.
- **The website queues the agent's `workspace-profile` task** and goes through
  `normalizeDomain`, rejecting null. Stored canonical, so re-saving uncanonically
  counts as a change and re-queues research.

### Gates in `proxy.ts`

Onboarding, then `/onboarding/research` for the Context key. Asked server-side every
request.

- **`getSessionCookie()` decides signed-in**; pages still resolve the real session via
  `requireMailboxAccess()`.
- **Nothing is cached in a cookie** — both facts revert on a database reset while a
  year-long marker insists the gate passed. Cache in the API if cost ever matters.
- **Both reads run concurrently**, but order decides which is *asked* — the research
  read is never made while onboarding is open.
- **An unreachable API fails open** (`unknown` lets the request through).
- **`/sign-in`, `/grant-access`, `/eve` are ungated.** `/sign-in` is the only path a
  stranger may read; `/` joins it only when `IS_MARKETING` is set.
- **There is no way past the key gate but to answer** — Skip stranded installs, every
  later company sitting `PENDING` with nothing saying so.

### The name is also the URL

Served under the workspace slug (`/comp-ai/companies`). **Cosmetic, not tenancy** —
every query still resolves through `WORKSPACE_ID`.

- **The slug is the plugin's column**, written by `workspaceSlug(name)`
  (`@crm/db/workspace`) on rename and create. **Never derive it on read.**
- `ensureWorkspaceMembership` reconciles it; `RESERVED_SLUGS` prevents collision with
  a real route (a collision gets `-crm`).
- **The proxy is the only thing that puts the slug on.** Missing or stale slugs are
  redirected with the query string intact, not 404'd; `[slug]/layout.tsx` is the
  backstop.
- `appPath` in `proxy.ts` is the one place `/` resolves for a signed-in rep, which
  keeps every `callbackURL` correct without knowing about slugs.
- **Renaming moves the URL**, so `workspace-form.tsx` replaces the location onto the
  slug `workspace.update` returns.

## SSO is a row, not a deployment

An `ssoProvider` row via Better Auth's `sso` plugin, on Settings → SSO, because a
self-hoster's admin cannot redeploy.

- **OpenID Connect only** — issuer, client id, secret; endpoints from discovery. No
  SAML UI: it needs an X.509 cert and SP signing key we have nowhere to keep.
- `SsoService` passes `WORKSPACE_ID`, never an input.
- **Management is tRPC (`sso.*`); signing in is `authClient.signIn.sso()`.**
- **`sso.signInOptions` is the one public procedure in the app.** Every other `sso.*`
  takes `AuthMiddleware` at the *method*, which is what leaves it open. A client
  secret is never read back out.
- **It is the API's answer, not the app's** — the API serves `/api/auth/*`.
- **An install with no Google, no Microsoft and no provider says so**, naming the
  variables; a read that *fails* falls back to offering Google.
- **A provider hides the social buttons, it does not disable them** —
  `/sign-in?method=google` and `?method=microsoft` still work, so a mistyped issuer
  cannot lock an admin out.
- **Signing in with an IdP does not cost you Gmail.** `needsMailboxGrant` (`@crm/auth`)
  walls only an account whose sign-in rows are *all* mailbox providers — Google,
  Microsoft, or both — and none of them granted. `mailboxGrantsNeeded` returns which,
  so `/grant-access` offers the button they can actually use.
- `ALLOWED_SIGN_IN` still decides who gets an account, in
  `databaseHooks.user.create.before`, for SSO sign-ups too.
- `organizationProvisioning: { disabled: true }` — `ensureWorkspaceMembership` already
  does the join.

## tRPC is the data surface; REST is auth and health only

- **One router per module**, `*.router.ts` (the codegen glob), with
  `@Router({ alias })` and `@UseMiddlewares(AuthMiddleware)`. **No `AuthMiddleware`
  means public — there is no other guard.**
- **Routers are thin**: zod in, service call out; Prisma lives in `*.service.ts`.
- Services throw Nest's `HttpException` family; `DomainErrorMiddleware` maps them.
- **Filter, sort and paginate in Prisma.** List procedures take `listInput` and return
  `{ rows, total, facetCounts }`. Never filter a whole table in the browser; never
  interpolate `sort` into a field name — use `resolveOrderBy`.
- **`src/generated/server.ts` is generated *and committed*, and `build` must never
  regenerate it** — the generator needs GLIBC 2.39, newer than Vercel's build image.
  Only `check-types` and `dev` run it. If the app cannot see a new procedure, it has
  not run.

## Two mail providers, one pipeline

`apps/api/src/mailbox` is everything neither Google nor Microsoft owns:
`MailboxApiClient` (bearer GET, and the one place a status code becomes an outcome),
`SyncStateService` (the `MailboxSync` row), `MailboxTokenService`,
`MailboxMatchService`, `participants.ts`, `message-text.ts`, and
`ThreadWriterService`.

- **`ThreadWriterService.store` is the only writer of `EmailThread`, `EmailMessage`
  and the `EMAIL` activity.** Gmail and Outlook each parse their own wire format down
  to one `IncomingMessage` and hand it over; matching, threading, counting and
  stamping happen once. A second copy of that is how a rule like *reply before you
  create a company* comes to be true in one inbox and not the other.
- **A thread is keyed by RFC message id, not by the provider's thread id.** Root comes
  from `References` → `In-Reply-To` → own `Message-ID`, so a rep on Gmail and a rep on
  Outlook land on the same `EmailThread` for the same conversation. Graph only returns
  `internetMessageHeaders` when `$select`ed and not for every message, so Outlook falls
  back to `outlook-conversation:<conversationId>` — threading that still holds inside
  Outlook, just not across to Gmail.
- **`MailboxSync.source` is the discriminator** — `calendar`, `gmail`, `outlook`. Each
  provider's module only ever sees its own, and `sync/mailbox-sync.service.ts` is the
  one place that dispatches. One cron, one budget:
  `POST /internal/sync/mailboxes` (`/google` is kept as an alias so an existing
  deployment's cron keeps working).
- **Gmail is forward-only from a `historyId`, Outlook from a timestamp.** Graph has no
  mailbox-wide delta, so the Outlook cursor is the last `receivedDateTime` seen,
  re-read with a one-second overlap; `rfcMessageId` is unique, so the overlap costs a
  duplicate fetch and never a duplicate row.
- **Microsoft has no token-revocation endpoint.** `revoke` clears the columns and the
  UI says the consent itself is removed in the user's Microsoft account. Google's still
  posts to `oauth2.googleapis.com/revoke` and refuses to clear if that fails.

## Not every address on a thread is a person

`externalParticipants` (`mailbox/participants.ts`) is the one gate, discarding **us**
(allow-list domains, `User` table), **rep decisions** (`SuppressedContact`,
`SuppressedDomain`), and **addresses no human reads**.

- **`isMachineDomain` (`companies/domain.ts`) sits beside `FREE_EMAIL_DOMAINS`**;
  `domainFromEmail` returns null for both, and `companyForEmail` is the only path from
  address to company — so a caller ignorant of the rule still cannot create one.
  `.calendar.google.com` covers shared calendars, rooms and ICS feeds.
- **Matches the host, never a substring** — `calendar.acme.com` is a real company.
- **`isMachineAddress` also catches opaque local parts** (24 hex chars, UUIDs),
  deliberately narrow: a false positive is a real customer never filed.
- **It leaves no row** — a rep may still type these into quick-add; only the *inbox*
  is barred from deciding. `syncAttendees` filters the same addresses beside
  `attendee.resource`.
- **`isAutomatedAddress` is a separate list about the local part** (`sales@`,
  `noreply@`), which is why `support@acme.com` never becomes a lead.

## People on a deal

`DealContact` is the join, and `deals.attachContact` / `detachContact` /
`setContactRole` are the only ways to write it. `deals.contactOptions` is what the
picker reads.

- **A contact on a deal works at that deal's company**, enforced in the service and
  not merely by the picker — the same rule as `companies.setPrimaryContact`.
- **Attaching is an upsert and re-attaching keeps the role already there**, so a
  double click cannot blank what somebody typed.
- **Detaching removes the row, never the contact.** They stay in the CRM, on the
  company, with their history.
- **`role` is blanked to null, never stored as `""`** — `blankToNull`, as everywhere
  else.

## Deleting a record

`contacts.delete`, `companies.delete`, `deals.delete`. No soft delete, no archive.

- **A deleted contact is suppressed by address**, or the sync recreates them from the
  next thread. `ContactsService.delete` writes `SuppressedContact`, and
  `externalParticipants` drops it like a `SuppressedDomain` — one filter covering
  contact creation, company auto-creation and attribution.
- **Keyed lower case.** `normalizeEmail` (`crm/values.ts`) is the one canonicaliser,
  on `contacts.create`, `.update` and the suppression; conflict checks and `allowAgain`
  match case-insensitively.
- **The address comes from the delete itself**
  (`tx.contact.delete({ select: { email: true } })`), not a read before it — and the
  404 is that statement's own `P2025` through `translate`.
- **Adding them back lifts the suppression** via `allowAgain` **inside the write's
  transaction**. Never automatic.
- **Deleting a company does not suppress its domain** — its people survive with no
  company, and domain suppression stays the explicit Settings → Connections control.
- **Clear `AgentTask` and `AgentEvent` yourself** — they carry `contactId`/`companyId`
  with no foreign key, so nothing cascades.
- **Recompute `lastActivityAt` on exactly the records the delete reached.**
  `ActivityStampService.targetsOf(where)` collects them *inside* the transaction (the
  evidence is what gets deleted); `recomputeMany` restamps. A company's `where` must
  follow its deals: `{ OR: [{ companyId }, { deal: { companyId } }] }`.
  `recomputeAll()` is for a purge only.
- **Recompute after commit, logging rather than throwing** — the row is already gone,
  and a raised error makes the browser skip invalidation and retry into a 404.

## Money

A deal is sold in one currency and reported in another, and **only `baseAmount` may
ever be summed**. The rules — `baseCurrency`, `countedWhere`/`pendingWhere`, frozen
rates, the supported currencies, the keyless feed, and why the fetcher is the one
documented exception to *no intelligence in the API* — are in **`docs/currency.md`**.
Read it before touching any amount, total, chart or rate.

## Freshness: invalidate the query, don't disable the cache

- **Invalidate in `onSuccess` through `useCrmCache()`** (`lib/trpc/cache.ts`), never by
  listing keys at the call site. Say what changed — `cache.deal(id)`,
  `cache.company(id)`, `cache.contact(id)`, `cache.activity()`. **A new mutation adds a
  call there, not a new list of keys.**
- **A deletion is `cache.removed(ref)`** — one wide fan-out, and the only place
  `refetchType: "none"` is right: the deleted record's `byId` query is still mounted
  while the sheet animates shut, so refetching reads a 404 into the closing sheet,
  while leaving it alone serves 30s of a dead record from cache.
- **`{ settle: "record" }`** for inline editors, so the field's spinner clears without
  waiting for the table.
- **Infinite queries need `pathKey()`, not `queryKey()`** — the latter stamps
  `{ type: "query" }` and silently cannot match `{ type: "infinite" }`.
  `activities.timeline` is read both ways.
- **`cache-manager` is per-value and opt-in**, not an interceptor;
  `AuthService.getProfile` is the model.
- **Background writes need polling, not invalidation** — `refetchInterval` while
  `PENDING`/`RUNNING`, via `isEnriching()` and `ENRICHMENT_POLL_MS`. **Lists poll too,
  not just the sheet.**
